# Tutorial overview

This set of tutorials will be presented in muliple short parts.  

At this time WebSharp only includes a very lightweight [DOM Interface](https://github.com/xamarin/WebSharp/tree/master/docs/tutorials/DOM) .  That does not mean that you can not access other HTML or HTML 5 functionality.  In this series of multiple short tutorials we will show how you can tap into the other functionality using `ScriptObject`'s and modeling those other API interfaces.  By wrapping the HTML functionality in higher-level custom classes we can create a strongly typed interface to build a custom library.

`Part 1` - The document you are reading now, will focus on quickly generating the application and creating the structure of the application for scripting the `navigator.geolocation` functionality.  Adding code to interface with the DOM Html Elements and handling the button `click` event.  Since the focus of this set of tutorials is the scripting interface, the application interface itself will be very minimal.

[Part 2](./GeolocationAPI.md) - Continuation from `Part 1` with the following:

* High level view of the Bridge interface that is used by `WebSharp`.
* Adding a new source module to the project.
* Incorporating the new source module in our application.
* Creating the basic singleton code to reference the `navigator,geolocation` object.

[Part 3](./part3.md) using the documentation from the [Geolocation API Specification](https://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html#navi-geo) we will then focus on the implementation details of our new module. 

[Part 4](./part4md) - By default when creating a `WebSharp Electron Application`, on-the-fly compiling is used so we will cover compiling these modules into actual assemblies.  [Getting Started Building Websharp Electron Application Assemblies](https://github.com/xamarin/WebSharp/blob/master/docs/getting-started/getting-started-websharp-building-assemblies.md).

[Part 5](./part5md) - Packaging our application using `electron-packager` so that we have an actual application to execute.


## End Goal

At the end of the series we will have created a simple application with a button that will call out to a strongly typed C# `navigation.geolocation` api to retrieve the current location and display a map image of that position.

If there are errors accessing the api then we will display them as well.

## Prerequisites

1. You need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and available in your $PATH.

   * `electron-dotnet` needs to be built.  The easiest way is to use the provided `make` files available in the WebSharp base directory.  
   
      * [See Getting Started on Windows](https://github.com/xamarin/WebSharp/blob/master/docs/getting-started/getting-started-dev-windows.md)
   
      * [See Getting Started on Mac](https://github.com/xamarin/WebSharp/blob/master/docs/getting-started/getting-started-dev-mac.md)

1. Optional icons used for your application.  These will be used when packaging the application later in the tutorial.  If not provided then the `Electron` default icons will be used.  See [Setting Application Icon - Mac and Windows](https://github.com/xamarin/WebSharp/tree/master/docs/tutorials/appicon#setting-application-icon---mac-and-windows)

1. To begin using the `navigator.geolocation` api provided by Google you will need to have an API Key.

### API keys

API keys are
freely available with a Google Account at https://developers.google.com/console.
To generate a server key for your project:

 1. Visit https://developers.google.com/console and log in with
    a Google Account.
 1. Select an existing project, or create a new project.
 1. Click **Enable an API**.
 1. Browse for `Geocoding API`, and set its status to "On". Other services are also available:
    * Directions API
    * Distance Matrix API
    * Elevation API
    * Time Zone API
    * Roads API
    * Street View Image API
 1. Once you've enabled the APIs, click **Credentials** from the left navigation of the Developer
    Console.
 1. In the "Public API access", click **Create new Key**.
 1. Choose **Server Key**.
 1. If you'd like to restrict requests to a specific IP address, do so now.
 1. Click **Create**.

Your API key should be 40 characters long, and begin with `AIza`.

**Important:** This key should be kept secret on your server.

## Creating the application

The first task is generating the application code so we can get started.  By following the [Create a new `WebSharp Electron Application`](https://github.com/xamarin/WebSharp/blob/master/docs/getting-started/getting-started-websharp-electron-application.md#generate-a-websharp-electron-application) getting started document we can quickly set up an application and get started.

![template geolocation](./images/template-geolocation.gif)

After you have the application generated you will need to open the project up into your favorite text editor.


## index.html

The first thing we will want to do is setup `index.html` file to create the elements that we will be interacting with.

```javascript

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>GeoLocation</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>GeoLocation</h1>
    <p><button id="findMe">Show my location</button></p>
    <p id="location"></p>
    <div id="out">
      <img id="map"></img>
    </div>
  </body>

  <script>
    // You can also require other files to run in this process
    require('./renderer.js')
  </script>
</html>

```

* This will create a button with the `id` of `findMe`:

```javascript
<p><button id="findMe">Show my location</button></p>
```

* An output area with the `id` of `location` that will display the location longitude and latitude on successful call to the geolocation api or the error(s) returned if the api was not able to complete successfully.

```javascript
<p id="location"></p>
```

* Our image area used to display the map image returned back from the geolocation api on succesful call.

```javascript
    <div id="out">
      <img id="map"></img>
    </div>
```

## Renderer process `Location.cs`

For right now let's set up the application to interact with our DOM elements defined in the `index.html` definition above.  This will only be preparation until we have the API defined in Part 2.  You can find out more about interacting with the DOM by reading the [DOM Overview](https://github.com/xamarin/WebSharp/blob/master/docs/tutorials/DOM/overview.md).

> :bulb: The `navigation.geolocation` can only be referenced in the `Renderer` process.  If you try referencing from the Main process you will get an error about the `navigation` object not being defined.  For that reason we will be focusing all of our attention in this module.

Open the `Location.cs` source file and let's add the following code.

```cs

    try
    {

        var document = await HtmlPage.GetDocument();
        var findMe = await document.GetElementById("findMe");
        var map = await document.GetElementById("map");
        var location = await document.GetElementById("location");

        // Click event listener code goes here

    }

```

### Html Element references

Obtain a reference to the `findMe` HtmlElement that represents a button tag `<button>`.

```cs
var findMe = await document.GetElementById("findMe");
```

Obtain a reference to the `map` HtmlElement that represents an image tag `<image>`.

```cs
var map = await document.GetElementById("map");
```

Obtain a reference to the `location` HtmlElement that represents a paragraph tag `<p>` that we will be using as our status area.

```cs
var location = await document.GetElementById("map");
```

### Button click event listener

When the `findMe` button is clicked is where the geolocation api will be called. To do this we will need to listen to the button's `click` event.

```cs

    await findMe.AttachEvent("click",
        new EventHandler(
            async (sender, evt) => {

                await location.SetProperty("innerText", "Locating ...");

            }
        )
    );

```

When we get a `click` from the button we will set our status area to `Locating...` by setting the `innerText` property of our HtmlElement `findeMe`.

```cs
    await location.SetProperty("innerText", "Locating ...");

```

Now if the application is run you will see the following:

## Summary

In this tutorial we went through creating a application and modifying the source to reference the DOM elements that will be needed in the following parts when we start implementing the `GeoLocation` interface.

We also saw how to interfact with DOM events by listening to the `click` event of the button tag `<button>`.

In the next part, [Part 2](./GeolocationAPI.md), of the tutorial we will start the `Scripting` of the `navigation.geolocation` HTML interface.

> :bulb: The `navigation.geolocation` can only be referenced in the `Renderer` process.  If you try referencing from the Main process you will get an error about the `navigation` object not being defined.
