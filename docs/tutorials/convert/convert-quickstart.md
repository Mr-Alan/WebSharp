* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your application
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your application.  The format of package.json is exactly the same as that of Nodeâ€™s modules, and the script specified by the main field is the startup script of your app, which will run the `main` process.  `Note:` If the main field is not present in package.json, Electron will attempt to load an index.js.
* `main.js` - this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your application.  The main.js should create windows and handle system events.
* `index.html` - this is the web page you want to show.
* `src/convert.js` - this src file defines calls the ConvertUI C# expression that will be printed to the console by default.
* `src/ConvertUI/ConvertUI.cs` - this src file is the C# managed code implementation of the application that prints to the console by default.
* `src/ConvertUI/ConvertUI.sln` and `src/ConvertUI/ConvertUI.csproj` - this solution file builds the files that make up the C# managed code implementation of the application.
* `src/Main/MainWindow.cs` - this src file is the C# managed code implementation of the application that allow the control of the application lifecycle events.
* `src/Main/MainWindow.sln` and `src/Main/MainWindow.csproj` - this solution file builds the files that make up the C# managed code implementation of the application that allow the control of the application lifecycle events.
* `src/Build.sln` - this solution file is a solution of solutions to provide a general build of the source projects `src/Main/MainWindow.sln` and `src/ConvertUI/ConvertUI.sln`.

## Get up and running straight away
* press `F5` to open a new window with your application loaded.
  * On Windows look for `Launch Windows` target
  * On Mac select the `Launch Mac` target
* run your command from the command terminal `npm start`.
  * (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `View:Toggle Integrated Terminal`
  * Use the (`Ctrl+'` or `Cmd+'` on Mac) keyboard shortcut with the backtick character.
  * Use the `View | Toggle Integrated Terminal` menu command.

## Debugging
* Requires `Node.js` and the `Chrome Debugger`.
  * Install the [Chrome Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) with `ext install debugger-for-chrome`
